Title: Codebook for Getting and Cleaning data project
date: 8/20/2019

Project Description: The goal of the project was to collect and tidy up a datset to be used for data analysis. A total of 10299 observations were collected and a total of 561 features.

Study Design: 30 Volunteers within the age of 19-48. Each person perfform daily activities including walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying. The Samsung Galaxy SII was used with it's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope. 3-axial linear acceleration and 3 axial angular velocity were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. The data was randomly partitioned so that 70% is considered the trainign set and 30% considered the test set. 

Guide to create tidy data: 
1) Downlaod data from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#
2) Import text files into R (or other software) 
3) Combine the training and test datasets
4) Only keep the columns containing mean and standard deviation
5) Label the columns in the data appropriately

Description of Variables: Dimensions of raw data are 10299 rows and 661 columns
For each record in the dataset, triaxial accelaeration and estimated body acceleration are recorded
Triaxial velocity from the gyroscope
A 561 feature vector with time and frequency domain variables
Identifier of subject who carried out experiment
